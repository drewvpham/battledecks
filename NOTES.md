  Deck generator?
  
How do we know if a match is ready to start? - What's that even mean.
  - Both players upload their presentations for that deck/round (youtube URL)
  - Commissioner approves and hits start match?

-> When a match is started, viewers can vote for winners.
  - Is there a timelimit for voting or is it up to the commissioner to start/end a match?

On the match show page, if you are logged in as the player in the match  
  and then the ability to upload a youtube URL of your presentation
  you should see the deck you have to use
    - in theory, for an online event, to prevent people from rehearsing the deck, we should show them their deck and force them to upload within 10 minutes or something...


We have the ability for the players to upload their presentations

Once both players have uploaded their presentations, allow users to vote on the presentations

- clean up / remove as much devise code not being used as possible.

How a Player Gets to Match
  - From homepage, sees current matches and upcoming tournaments.
    current matches links to a match that player has to upload a presentation for (match#show) and lists matches people are voting on or that have ended recently.
  - From Current Matches (/matches/current), sees matches requirng activity.
  - From Tournaments/Playing, sees current match and active tournament matches.
  - Notification Nav in Utility Nav with messages of required activity.

Player Match Flow
  Once player lands on Match#show for an active match that they have activity on.

  Give Them Instructions:
    - For online tournaments
      1. From the moment they download the deck, they will have 30 minutes to upload a youtube
    - For in-person tournaments
      1. Comissioner or a player can upload at whatever time.

Uploading a presentation for a match:
  http://localhost:3000/tournaments/4/matches/35/presentations/new
  1. You are either player_1, player_2, or a commissioner of this tournament.
  2. The match has "started".
